    To upload a disk image to a compliant OCI registry the [ORAS]() tool is recommended, as this will simplify the process of creating a new "artifact" that can be used by`oci2disk`.

    * Pushing an OS image to a Harbor Registry with oras *
    The below example will push a `debian` image to a registry:

    ```
    oras push  192.168.0.173/test/debian:raw.gz --manifest-config /dev/null:application/vnd.acme.rocket.config ./debian.raw.gz --insecure
    ```

    We can then use this image by referring too it with teh `IMG_URL` environment variable.

    ```
    actions:
      - name: "stream-debian-image"
          image: oci2disk:v1.0.0
          timeout: 600
          environment:
            DEST_DISK: /dev/nvme0n1
            IMG_URL: "192.168.0.173/test/debian:raw.gz"
            COMPRESSED: true
    ```

    ##Â Compression format supported:

    * bzip2 (`.bzip2`)
    * gzip (`.gz`)
    * xz (`.xz`)
    * xs (`.xs`)
