    Under the hood this action uses qemu-img which in turn is built atop libcurl. This has two nice benefits:

    1. Full SSL support allows images to be streamed from anywhere on the internet
    2. Support for the QCOW2 image format which is used by some OS vendors as a standard format
    This action could be used as part of a workflow to stream the latest Ubuntu image directly from Canonical onto block storage disk `/dev/sda` like so:

    ```
    actions:
        - name: "stream ubuntu"
          image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/qemuimg2disk:v1.0.0
          timeout: 300
          environment:
              IMG_URL: https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/daily/server/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
              DEST_DISK: /dev/sda
    ```
